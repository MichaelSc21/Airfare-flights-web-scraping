<h3> Current stage I am at: </h3>

<p> I had been able to satinise the data by creating a dictionary from the json file. </p>
<p>The file includes: the number of stops, the currency and the price of each flight. This is for every single date.</p>
<p> I am now going to create dataframe based on this dictionary that I created.</p>

<p><b> Note to self: when trying to iterate through a column or row of a dataframe, use the apply() or map() method to get advantage of vectorisation</b></p>
